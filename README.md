# CSR Detector ROS (with Rviz)

![Demo](docs/demo.gif "Demo")

This repository contains the ROS version of CSR-based object detector which provides a wrapper over [csr_sensors](https://github.com/snt-arg/csr_sensors) and [csr_detector](https://github.com/snt-arg/csr_detector) and provides an Rviz user interface for monitoring the results. Accordingly, the application is dependant to the repositories below:

## üìö Preparation

### I. Cloning

Create a new workspace and clone the repo in its `src` folder. This repo has some submodules which have been added using the command `git submodule add git@[repo].git src/[name]`. When cloning the repository include `--recurse-submodules` after `git clone` such that the submodules are added as well. Accordingly, you can use the command below:

```
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:snt-arg/csr_detector_ros.git
```

You can also get the latest changes of each submodule individually using the command `git pull --recurse-submodules`. After cloning the repository, you can add a command like `alias sourcecsr='source ~/workspace/ros/csr_detector_ros_ws/devel/setup.bash'` in your `.bashrc` file.

### II. Installing Libraries

Install the required Python libraries for running this program using the command below:

```
pip install numpy opencv-python
```

### III. Installing Submodule Packages

The next step is to intall the cloned submodules and define dependencies and other distribution-related configurations using the provided `setup.py` file in the root directory. Then, run `pip install -e .` in the **root directory** to install the package and its dependencies. You can also run the same command in the submodules directories to install them.

### IV. Build Catkin Package

Finally, when everything has been installed, you can run `catkin build` to build the files.

## üöÄ Running the Code

When everything is ready, you can source the workspace (running `sourcecsr` as described before) and run one of the nodes listed below:

| Launcher                      | Description                                   |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `csr_detector_usb.launch`     | Runs the USB cameras version of the code      |
| `csr_detector_ids.launch`     | Runs the iDS cameras version of the code      |
| `csr_detector_rs.launch`      | Runs the RealSense camera version of the code |
| `csr_detector_usbMono.launch` | Runs the mono USB camera version of the code  |

There are also some arguments that you can configure based on your scenario:

- `show_rviz`: Runs an Rviz node when running the main node (default: true)

For instance, the below command runs the RealSense version of CSR detector while not running Rviz:

```
roslaunch csr_detector_ros csr_detector_rs.launch show_rviz:=false
```

## üî© ArUco Marker Recognition

In order to recognize markers, you need to run `aruco_ros` library [link](https://github.com/pal-robotics/aruco_ros) separately and feed it with `/result_mask` and `/rs_camera_params` topic. For doing this, you should follow below steps:

- Create a separate `launch` file for `aruco_ros` library. It should remap `/result_mask` and `/rs_camera_params` of the repository with `/image` and `/camera_info` topics of `aruco_ros`, respectively. A sample can be found [here](docs/aruco_ros_csr_marker.launch).
- Run the program using `roslaunch csr_detector_ros csr_detector_rs.launch`

‚ö†Ô∏è The current version of the code works for Mono-camera RealSense library only. Other sensors will have this ability later.
